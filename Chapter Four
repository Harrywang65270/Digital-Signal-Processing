Chapter Four: The z-transform

There are two shortcomings to the Fourier transform approach. First, there are many useful signals 
in practice- such s u(n) and nu(n) - for which the discrete-time Fourier transform doest not exist.
Second, the transient response of a system due to initial conditions or due to changing inputs cannot
be computed using the discrete-time Fourier transfrom approach.

4.4.1 System function from the difference equation representation

It should be noted that the freqz function can also be used for numerical computation of the DTFT
of a finite-duration, causal sequence x(n). In this approach, b = x and a = 1.
